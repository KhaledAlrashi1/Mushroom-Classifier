# Mushroom Classifier
![mushroom image](images/colorful_mushrooms.png) 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying mushrooms into edible and poisonous categories. Using a dataset containing 61,069 instances of 173 mushroom species, the goal is to analyze 15 different features (such as cap shape and stem height) to build accurate classification models. I employ various machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron, to achieve this.

## Features and Dataset
    Dataset: The dataset includes 61,069 mushrooms categorized into 173 species.
    Features: 15 features per mushroom, including physical characteristics like cap shape, color, and dimensions.

## Summary
At the end of our project, we successfully used data processing and machine learning to classify mushrooms. We learned which features are most important and how different models perform. Our work shows that with the right data and tools, we can effectively tell apart edible and poisonous mushrooms. This is useful for anyone interested in mushrooms, from experts to everyday enthusiasts, providing a good example of how machine learning can be applied in real life. I hope you find it useful. Please let me know if you have any questions.
